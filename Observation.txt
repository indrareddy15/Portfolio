1.The pips-prosper-journal prepopulated data by Lovable and project are complex, involving a backend database (Supabase with PostgreSQL).
2.Do we need to use the same schema as the existing one? Beacuse I am planning to use MongoDB instead.
3.If we're switching to MongoDB, migrating the code from Supabase with PostgreSQL will take longer than expected because we'll need to review 4.the design of every table and schema. (Migration isn't an issue for me; I can handle it.)
5.If we go with a new schema, it would be easier since we’d be building it from scratch. We'll know exactly where the gaps are, but we need to ensure the schema is optimized.
6.I've reviewed the code so far, and I’ve identified the APIs that are required.
7.Please confirm whether you want an exact replica of the current application with Supabase for the backend APIs.
8.I’ve completed the authentication part with a basic, generic schema and 8 endpoints. However, the email service isn’t configured yet (I need to discuss it, as I'm currently exploring free email services).
